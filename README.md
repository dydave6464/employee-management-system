The Employee Management System is a desktop-based application developed using C# WinForms and MySQL as the backend database. It is designed to help organizations manage their employee records more efficiently by providing a user-friendly interface to perform key operations.

The system supports CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update, Delete), allowing users to:

Create new employee records with details such as name, gender, contact number, salary, position, status, and photo.

Read and display active/inactive employees using a dynamic DataGridView.

Update existing records to reflect changes such as promotions, contact updates, or status changes.

Soft delete records by updating the delete date, while keeping the data retrievable if needed.

It also includes:

Active/Inactive employee counter dashboard

Image uploading per employee

Basic data validation (e.g., numeric salary fields, non-empty inputs)
